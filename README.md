# <Week One Refractor SEO Challenge>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was simple: we love clean code! Taking what was a jumbled, messy site before and leaving behind a cleaner, more compact version of itself was extremely satisfying. I found it to be a great review of skills learned in week one of our bootcamp. 

The project was built to satisfy client demands for cleaner code in general, but also the addition of new features to the website (clear and concise title, new alt text added for photos.) We also solved several preexisting problems within the site's structure, including a lack of semantic elements, and an illogical structure of elements. 

Along the way, we learned new skills and polished old ones. I learned a lot about the applications (and limitations) of flexbot. My ability to debug, read over code, and search the internet for advice/answers was also tested. One of the most important things I learned, however, was the usefulness of the inspect button in google chrome dev, especially in relation to it's ability to help visualize the front-end side of the code I am looking at. 


## Installation
Accessing the webpage requires only an internet connection and a internet browser. I recommend Google Chrome, for it's versatility.
